1. Write a program that obtains two integers from user and displays (for 500 and 125):
    
    number1 = 500   number2 = 125
    500 + 125 = 625
    500 - 125 = 375
    
2. Write a program that obtains two integers from user (the sides of rectangle and then displays: “The area of the rectangle with side 1 = ….  and side 2 =...... is ......” and the result calculated using the formula side1*side2

3. Write a program that obtains two integers from user and displays (for 12 and 3):

12 + 3 = 15
12 - 3 = 9

4. Write a program that obtains a radius from user and then displays: “The area of a circle with radius …..” and the result calculated using the formula 3.14*r*r

5. Write a program that asks the user’s name and displays “Hello *…….. !*” on the screen.

6. Write a program that asks the user’s name and displays “Your name start with char .....” on the screen.

7.* Write a program that calculates how many extra calories there will be if you’ll buy a pizza with a diameter of 28 cm instead of a pizza with a diameter of 24 cm. To solve this, let's assume that each square centimeter of pizza is 40 calories.
